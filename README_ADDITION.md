- Query Timeouts: 30s default timeout (configurable)
- Connection Cleanup: Proper pooling and graceful shutdown
- Resource Limits: Max 10,000 rows per query
- Connection Pooling: Max 10 open, 5 idle, 30min lifetime

### Phase 2: Reliability and Observability
- Rate Limiting: 10 queries/second (configurable)
- Retry Logic: Exponential backoff with 3 retries
- Self-Monitoring Metrics:
  - snowflake.receiver.queries.total
  - snowflake.receiver.errors.total
  - snowflake.receiver.retries.total
  - snowflake.receiver.success.rate

Configuration: query_timeout, max_rows_per_query, rate_limit_qps, max_retries, retry_initial_delay, retry_max_delay
